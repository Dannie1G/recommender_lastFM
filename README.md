# recommender_lastFM

Two different recommender systems were explored in this project: one based on a weighted model of artist popularity (Simple Recommender) and another based on user similarity (User Based Recommender).

The former is a simple approach that could be use to tackle the cold-start problem (in the case of new users)

For the latter, two collaborative filtering models were explored: one using cosine similarity and another using matrix factorization.

It would be interesting to utilize the data available for user tagging and user friends to improve the collaborative filtering model.
